# 60_IMPLEMENTATION-OF-CPU-SCHEDULING-ALGORITHMS

## This project implements several CPU scheduling algorithms to simulate and evaluate their performance. The scheduling algorithms included in this project are:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Round Robin (RR) with varying time quantum
- Shortest Process Next (SPN)
- Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
- Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)
- Feedback (FB)
- Feedback with varying time quantum (FBV)
- Aging
